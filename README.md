# Mobile-Sales-Analysis
A PowerBI Project to Analyze Mobile Sales

A mobile retailer wants to analyze sales performance across different countries, distributors, and operators. They aim to identify trends over time, evaluate profit margins, and understand the impact of pricing on sales volume. The company seeks to optimize its sales strategy by focusing on high-margin products and underperforming regions. Using Power BI, they plan to create an interactive dashboard to visualize and analyze sales data for better decisionmaking in marketing and pricing.
